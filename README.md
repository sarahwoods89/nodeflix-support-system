# Nodeflix Support System

A gRPC-powered customer support chatbot for **Nodeflix**, a fictional blockchain-based movie rental platform. This project is part of my Distributed Systems coursework at the National College of Ireland. All credit for this idea, which I wanted to base it around for my own brain to help me fully understand and be able to convey that I know waht I'm talking about in my presentation video, is to a company called FLINK - the OG Web3 rental platform - helping more stories be shared. 

-  AI-style chatbot that replies to user messages
-  Sentiment analysis to detect user tone
-  Ticketing system for escalating angry/frustrated users
-  Supports **all four types of gRPC**:
  - ✅ Unary
  - ✅ Server Streaming
  - ✅ Client Streaming
  - ✅ Bidirectional Streaming
